1. Implement one-many association for Company and Employee.(Make sure to have rating,startYear for Employee)
2. Implement many-many association for Trainee and StudyMaterial.
3. With help of an anonymous inner class, implement any abstract method of the interface. Observe on working of anonymous Inner class here.
4. hashCode(), equals(), toString() and .equals(), .parseInt()=>Perform programs
5. Design a class OnlyOnce and make sure that only one time it is instantiated. 
6. User should be asked to enter any date.
	1 method checks if input date is earlier to present date.
	1 method checks if input date is after to present date.
	1 method converts given date into "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ssZ" pattern.

7. In an array of 1-10, multiple numbers are duplicates, how do you find duplicates using Map implemented classes.
8. Using TreeSet, make sure to add varied data types to the set including Upper and Lower case and predict your output.
9. Perform analysis on ListIterator and Iterator and provide your handson examples on each analysis.

10. A thread  has "add" operation,other thread performs"avg" and 
	other thread performs "display" operation which  displays avg and add details after the two threads are compeletely performed.6
11. Display all the properties of running threads. Create 3 threads and rename thread1 to "yourName" and make this thread a daemon thread.
	Get the updated thread details. 
13. For any created thread, Observe the thread life cycle on each run.

14. Employee has methods for create, read and write to a file.
	Manager extends employer and have these file methods overriden(Examine here without handling the exceptions) along with delete the file.
15. Write the details of Employee class to a file in your local and make this file non-editable.
16. Convert from CSV to excel.
17. Convert from Excel to a CSV File.


18. Fetch Employee details on decreasing order of their rating and decreasing order of their StartYear from Q.14.
19. Implement an exception "InvalidUserName".
	User inputs his UserName in console. When length of userName is <10 or if it has "&", this should be handled by the exception.

20. Methods of Iterator:hasNext(),next(),remove()
	Methods of ListIterator:add(E e),hasNext(),hasPrevious(),next(),nextIndex(),previous(),previousIndex(),remove(),set(E e)	 
21. Class named Operations have final variables like plus,minus,divide and multiply.
	This class has a method named calculate which takes 2 inputs of type double and return value in double
		inside calculate: if plus, inputs are added and returned.(similarly for other methods minus,divide and multiply).
			  	  AssertionError is also thrown when user doesn't perform any of these operations in default.
	In your main method: calculate all 4 results and have these printed in console.
	Make sure to have dynamic inputs.


22. Provide an interface Company with 
	default method of return type double calculating the profit(CP-SP)
	static method of return type String which takes (double) input from previous method and returns company name.
	Abstract method String getCompDetails(double profit,String name);=>Needs to be implemented using Lambda expression.
23. Perform calculations such as count,sum,min,avg,max for given input of arrayList using Stream API.
24. Using Consumer Interface,print stream of integers ranging from 1 to 10 and make sure to neglect numbers between 3 and 7.
25. Using Consumer Interface,print stream of integers ranging from 1 to 10 and double these numbers in your output.
26. Perform handson on every methods on OptionalClass, ParallelSort, StringJoiner,Collector class in Streams.

27. Exceptions with many catches and its order of execution.
	examine on specific to general. Make sure to include both compile time and runtime exceptions in it.
	try followed by catch and finally with return in all blocks. Examine output.
	try followed by catch with return in both blocks. Examine output.
